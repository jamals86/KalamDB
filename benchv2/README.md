# KalamDB Benchmarking Tool

## Overview
The KalamDB Benchmarking Tool is designed to facilitate performance testing of the KalamDB database. It provides a framework for running various benchmark tests, generating detailed reports in both JSON and HTML formats, and allows for easy addition of new benchmark tests.

## Project Structure
- **src/**: Contains the core library code for the benchmarking tool.
  - **lib.rs**: Core library code defining main structures and functions.
  - **main.rs**: Entry point for the benchmarking tool, initializes the application and triggers benchmark runs.
  - **config.rs**: Handles configuration settings for the benchmarking tool.
  - **runner.rs**: Logic for executing benchmarks and collecting metrics.
  - **reporter/**: Module for different reporting strategies.
    - **json_reporter.rs**: Generates JSON reports of benchmark results.
    - **html_reporter.rs**: Generates HTML reports of benchmark results.
  - **client.rs**: Client logic for interacting with the KalamDB server.
  - **metrics.rs**: Structures and functions for collecting and processing benchmark metrics.
  - **benchmarks/**: Organizes benchmark tests.
    - **insert_bench.rs**: Benchmark test for insert operations.
    - **select_bench.rs**: Benchmark test for select operations.
    - **update_bench.rs**: Benchmark test for update operations.
    - **delete_bench.rs**: Benchmark test for delete operations.
    - **bulk_insert_bench.rs**: Benchmark test for bulk insert operations.
    - **concurrent_read_bench.rs**: Benchmark test for concurrent read operations.
    - **concurrent_write_bench.rs**: Benchmark test for concurrent write operations.
    - **mixed_workload_bench.rs**: Benchmark test for mixed workload operations.

- **templates/**: Contains templates for generating reports.
  - **report.html**: HTML template for the benchmark report.
  - **styles.css**: CSS styles for the HTML report.

- **results/**: Directory for storing benchmark results.
  - **.gitkeep**: Keeps the results directory in version control.

- **tests/**: Contains tests for the benchmarking tool.
  - **integration.rs**: Integration tests for the benchmarking tool.
  - **reporter_tests.rs**: Unit tests for the reporting functionality.

- **run-benchmarks.sh**: Shell script to run benchmarks in a Unix-like environment.

- **run-benchmarks.ps1**: PowerShell script to run benchmarks in a Windows environment.

- **Cargo.toml**: Configuration file for the Rust project.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd KalamDB
   ```

2. **Build the Project**: 
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Start the KalamDB Server**: 
   Ensure the KalamDB server is running before executing benchmarks.

4. **Run Benchmarks**: 
   Use the provided scripts to run benchmarks:
   - For Unix-like systems:
     ```bash
     ./run-benchmarks.sh
     ```
   - For Windows:
     ```powershell
     .\run-benchmarks.ps1
     ```

## Adding New Benchmarks
To add a new benchmark test:
1. Create a new Rust file in the `src/benchmarks/` directory.
2. Implement the benchmark logic and metrics collection.
3. Update `src/benchmarks/mod.rs` to include the new benchmark.

## Reporting
The tool generates reports in both JSON and HTML formats:
- JSON reports are generated by `json_reporter.rs` and saved to the specified location.
- HTML reports are generated by `html_reporter.rs` using the `report.html` template.
