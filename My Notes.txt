Things to add to the spec:
- Double check if we can use kalamdb-store with kalamdb-sql instead of calling rocksdb directly from kalamdb-sql
- instead of relying on rocksdb with features like column-families, make the project generic so we can add any
    type of storage like sled/redis or anything else
- Maybe its better to have a crate like kalamdb-commons which will be included in all other crates for:
    - models like user_id/namespace_id/..
    - ids
    - system helpers
    - System tables names instead of having multiple places where we name them
    - Any system things that is shared between or needed in -sql/-store/-core


Features:
- Make the project has a generic serdes models, so we can change the serialization from the json
- A new table called user_files which is a table per user
- KFlows - Add a workflow triggers which also listen to streams, actions being done and write to the database
- KFlows will be used for system maintainance like: replication/backup and also periodict cleanup of deleted rows
- Sharding the user's own table's into multiple column families, for example: userA will be redirected to Shard A -> with users.shard-a.messages
    If we have like 5 user tables and 10 shards in total we will have 50 column families
- Raft Cluster - System tables should be replicated to all nodes
- Raft Cluster - User tables each shard should have a group in the cluster and replicated accordingly
