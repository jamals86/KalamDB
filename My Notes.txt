Things to add to the spec:
- Include TODO's found in the codebase, maybe some needs to be added to the plan and tasks
- Re-write the README it has things outdated now
    - Remove the parquet mentioning that much it can be mentioned only once max
    - Add also mention that the websocket is directly opened to the server no need for another service in the middle
- Add also branch and revision from git to the version when running the server prompt
- Log the size of the rocksdb database
- RocksDB folder should be configured using the config .toml file and also by default it need to sit next to the binary file and not temporary table

- make tests run either on local server or on temporary server like its doing now
- Double check if we can use kalamdb-store with kalamdb-sql instead of calling rocksdb directly from kalamdb-sql
- Check if ddls can be included inside kalamdb-sql as well since they belong there, if it's not all maybe the names or models only
- Default catalog for system tables is system, no need for a different one
- instead of relying on rocksdb with features like column-families, make the project generic so we can add any
    type of storage like sled/redis or anything else
- Maybe its better to have a crate like kalamdb-commons which will be included in all other crates for:
    - models like user_id/namespace_id/..
    - ids
    - system helpers
    - System tables names instead of having multiple places where we name them
    - Any system things that is shared between or needed in -sql/-store/-core
- Make sure the user can't listen to a shared table since this will ruin performance
- Add crate for kalamdb-live which is responsible for live subscribers logic and it's communicate with the kalamdb-store and kalamdb-sql
- Instead of having something like this: let cf_name = format!("user_table:{}:{}", namespace_id, table_name); let cf_name = format!("shared_table:{}:{}", namespace_id, table_name);
    make this a helper class which deals with naming, for system/shared/user
- "_deleted" and "_updated" should be stored one time only, currently we are always writing them as string's
- Make sure we use the actor model for the flush jobs so we can view them easily just like live queries/streams/backup jobs as well
- Make sure for expr check like in live_queries we use datafusion expressions and cache them
- For sql functions we can use the datafusion own functions as well
- Make sure when we select/insert/delet/update user table if we specify FROM namespace1.user.user_files then it will be like: FROM namespace1.jamal86.user_files
    Specify .user. should have X-USER-ID in the header if not then there should be an error
    Instead of from("system") we should pass the exact user_id
- ShowBackupStatement for example has the same str: "SHOW BACKUP FOR DATABASE" multiple times, change the code to have it as an enum one time
- In API query result, also return the time took for the query to process, this need to be an option in the configuration toml

Features:
- Add CLI tool which is using the API and you can login with specific user to do the actions inside of it, this should be a separate binary
- Make the project has a generic serdes models, so we can change the serialization from the json
- A new table called user_files which is a table per user for storing files and their references in the storage location we have
- KFlows - Add a workflow triggers which also listen to streams, actions being done and write to the database
- KFlows will be used for system maintainance like: replication/backup and also periodict cleanup of deleted rows
- Sharding the user's own table's into multiple column families, for example: userA will be redirected to Shard A -> with users.shard-a.messages
    If we have like 5 user tables and 10 shards in total we will have 50 column families
- Raft Cluster - System tables should be replicated to all nodes
- Raft Cluster - User tables each shard should have a group in the cluster and replicated accordingly
- User can easily download his data
