Future:
1) Alter a table and move it';s storage from storage_id to different one
2) Support changing stream table TTL via ALTER TABLE
3) Combine all the subscription logic for stream/user tables into one code base
6) Make sure _updated timestamp include also nanosecond precision
7) when reading --file todo-app.sql from the cli ignore the lines with -- since they are comments, and create a test to cover this case
8) Inside kalam-link instead of having 2 different websockets implementations to use only one which also supports the wasm target, by doing so we can reduce code duplication and have less maintenance burden
9) Implement users/roles and authentication keys using oauth or jwt tokens, this should replace the api_key thing we have now
10) in query inside where clause support comparison operators for null values, like IS NULL and IS NOT NULL
