# Feature Specification: Simple KalamDB - User-Based Database with Live Queries

**Feature Branch**: `002-simple-kalamdb`  
**Created**: 2025-10-14  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Simple user-based database with namespaces, user/shared/system tables, live queries with change tracking, and flush policies"

## 🚀 Architectural Differentiator: Table-Per-User Multi-Tenancy

**The Power of Per-User Tables**: Unlike traditional databases that store all users' messages in a shared table, KalamDB uses a **table-per-user architecture** where each user's data lives in isolated storage partitions (`{userId}/batch-*.parquet`). This fundamental design decision unlocks unprecedented scalability:

**Key Advantages**:

1. **Massive Scalability for Real-time Subscriptions**
   - Traditional approach: Complex database triggers on a shared table with billions of rows
   - KalamDB approach: Simple file-level notifications per user partition
   - Result: **Millions of concurrent users** can maintain real-time subscriptions without performance degradation

2. **O(1) Subscription Complexity**
   - Each user's subscription monitors only their own partition
   - Performance independent of total user count
   - No expensive WHERE userId = ? filtering on massive shared tables

3. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Adding new users creates new isolated partitions
   - No impact on existing user performance
   - Storage and query operations naturally parallelized

4. **Simplified Real-time Implementation**
   - Monitor file changes in user-specific directories
   - Eliminates complex trigger logic on shared database tables
   - Predictable, consistent notification latency regardless of scale

**Example Comparison**:
```
Traditional Shared Table (Redis/Postgres):
- 1M users × 1 subscription = 1M WHERE clauses on shared messages table
- Performance degrades as table grows to billions of rows
- Complex trigger management and connection pooling

KalamDB Table-Per-User:
- 1M users × 1 subscription = 1M independent file watchers
- Each user's partition isolated (typically KB to MB in size)
- Simple, parallel, O(1) complexity per user
```

This architecture is what makes KalamDB capable of supporting millions of concurrent real-time subscriptions while maintaining sub-millisecond write performance and efficient query execution.

## Data Flow Architecture

### Write Path (User Tables & Shared Tables)

KalamDB uses a **two-tier storage architecture** to balance write performance with persistent storage:

1. **Hot Storage (RocksDB Buffer)**:
   - All INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations first write to RocksDB
   - RocksDB acts as a fast, in-memory/disk hybrid buffer
   - Enables sub-millisecond write acknowledgments to clients
   - Maintains recent data for fast queries

2. **Cold Storage (Parquet Files)**:
   - Data periodically flushed from RocksDB to Parquet format
   - Parquet files written to configured storage backend (S3 or filesystem)
   - Optimized for analytical queries and long-term storage
   - Immutable once written (append-only model)

**Complete Write Flow**:

```
Client Request (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
    ↓
REST API / WebSocket Handler
    ↓
Write to RocksDB (hot storage)
    ↓
[Acknowledge to client - fast!]
    ↓
Buffered in RocksDB until flush policy triggered:
  - Row limit reached (e.g., 10,000 rows)
  - OR Time interval elapsed (e.g., 5 minutes)
    ↓
Flush Job Starts:
  - Record job in system.jobs table (status='running')
  - Read buffered data from RocksDB
  - Serialize to Parquet format
  - Write to storage backend (S3 or filesystem)
    ↓
For User Tables: ${user_id}/batch-*.parquet
For Shared Tables: shared/table_name/batch-*.parquet
    ↓
Flush Job Completes:
  - Clear flushed data from RocksDB buffer
  - Update system.jobs (status='completed', result, trace, metrics)
  - Notify live query subscribers of changes
```

**Storage Location Examples**:
- User table: `s3://bucket/users/user123/messages/batch-20251015-001.parquet`
- Shared table: `s3://bucket/shared/conversations/batch-20251015-001.parquet`

### Read Path (User Tables & Shared Tables)

Queries execute across **both storage tiers** to provide complete data:

```
Client Query (SELECT)
    ↓
DataFusion Query Planner
    ↓
Query Execution Strategy:
  1. Determine query time range (if WHERE clause has timestamp filter)
  2. Check RocksDB buffer for matching data
     - Always includes most recent writes (not yet flushed)
  3. Check Parquet files using bloom filters
     - _updated timestamp used as bloom filter
     - Only scan Parquet files overlapping query range
  4. DataFusion merges results from both sources:
     - Union data from RocksDB and Parquet
     - Apply WHERE filters across merged dataset
     - Handle _deleted column (exclude rows where _deleted = true)
  5. Sort and deduplicate if needed
    ↓
Return results to client
```

**Query Optimization with System Columns**:
- **_updated (TIMESTAMP)**: Automatically added to every user/shared table
  - Used as Parquet bloom filter for efficient time-range queries
  - Enables efficient "changes since timestamp" queries
  - Updated on both INSERT and UPDATE operations
  
- **_deleted (BOOLEAN)**: Automatically added to every user/shared table
  - Soft delete mechanism (rows marked deleted, not physically removed)
  - Queries filter out rows where _deleted = true by default
  - Enables change tracking for deletions (subscribers can detect deleted rows)
  - Retention policy determines when deleted rows are physically removed

**Example Query Flow**:
```sql
-- User query
SELECT * FROM messages WHERE created_at > '2025-10-14' AND _deleted = false;

-- Execution:
-- 1. RocksDB: Scan buffer, filter by created_at and _deleted
-- 2. Parquet: Use _updated bloom filter to skip old files
--    Only scan files where _updated overlaps '2025-10-14' or later
-- 3. DataFusion: Merge results, apply WHERE clause
-- 4. Return combined dataset
```

**Live Query Change Detection**:
```sql
-- Live subscription
SUBSCRIBE SELECT * FROM messages WHERE conversation_id = 'conv123';

-- Change tracking uses _updated and _deleted:
-- INSERT: New row with _updated = NOW(), _deleted = false
-- UPDATE: Modified row with _updated = NOW(), _deleted = false
-- DELETE: Row marked with _deleted = true, _updated = NOW()
-- 
-- Subscribers receive:
-- - INSERT events: rows where _deleted = false (new data)
-- - UPDATE events: rows where _deleted = false (modified data)  
-- - DELETE events: rows where _deleted = true (soft deleted)
```

### Stream Tables (Ephemeral Architecture)

Stream tables use a **different architecture** optimized for transient, real-time events:

```
Client INSERT (ephemeral event)
    ↓
Write to RocksDB or in-memory buffer ONLY
    ↓
[Acknowledge to client]
    ↓
Event buffered with TTL:
  - Retention policy: automatic eviction after TTL (e.g., 10s)
  - Max buffer: oldest events evicted when limit reached (e.g., 1000 events)
  - Ephemeral mode: discard immediately if no subscribers
    ↓
Live Query Subscribers:
  - Real-time delivery to active WebSocket connections
  - No disk I/O, memory-only operations
    ↓
Events NEVER flushed to Parquet or persistent storage
    ↓
After retention period: Events automatically deleted from buffer
```

**Key Differences from Persistent Tables**:
- ❌ No Parquet files created
- ❌ No flush jobs (never persisted)
- ❌ No S3/filesystem writes
- ✅ Memory/RocksDB only (hot storage)
- ✅ Automatic TTL-based cleanup
- ✅ Ultra-low latency delivery to subscribers

### Live Query Subscriptions & Change Tracking

Live queries monitor **both storage tiers** for changes using a **distributed actor-based architecture**:

```
Client WebSocket Connection
    ↓
Generate unique connection_id for this WebSocket
    ↓
Create WebSocket Actor in Actix (Addr<WebSocketSession>)
    ↓
Store in memory: connection_id → ConnectedWebSocket { actor: Addr<WebSocketSession>, live_ids: Vec<String> }
    ↓
Client sends subscription array with user-chosen query_ids:
[
  { query_id: "messages", sql: "SELECT * FROM messages WHERE..." },
  { query_id: "notifications", sql: "SELECT * FROM notifications WHERE..." }
]
    ↓
For each subscription:
  - **User Table Scope**: If table is a user table, implicitly add `AND user_id = CURRENT_USER()` filter
    (users can ONLY subscribe to their own partition for security and performance)
  - **Shared/Stream Tables**: No implicit filter (users see all data subject to permissions)
  - Generate live_id = connection_id + "-" + query_id (e.g., "conn123-messages")
  - Register in system.live_queries table (RocksDB) with live_id as key
  - Store in memory: live_id → connection_id
  - Add live_id to ConnectedWebSocket.live_ids vector
    ↓
Monitor for changes:
  1. RocksDB writes (immediate notification)
  2. Flush operations (batch notification)
    ↓
Match against subscription filter (WHERE clause)
    ↓
For each matching live_id:
  - Check node field in system.live_queries
  - If node == current_node:
      - Lookup connection_id from live_id mapping
      - Lookup ConnectedWebSocket from connection_id mapping
      - Send message to actor (ConnectedWebSocket.actor)
      - Include query_id in notification (extracted from live_id)
      - Increment changes counter in system.live_queries
      - Update updated_at timestamp
    ↓
Send change notification to client:
  - query_id: "messages" (so client knows which subscription matched)
  - change_type: INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
  - rows: changed data
    ↓
On WebSocket disconnect:
  - Lookup ConnectedWebSocket by connection_id
  - For each live_id in ConnectedWebSocket.live_ids:
      - Delete from system.live_queries table
      - Remove from live_id → connection_id mapping
  - Remove connection_id → ConnectedWebSocket mapping
```

**In-Memory Registry Structure**:
```rust
// Data structures for in-memory registry
struct ConnectedWebSocket {
    actor: Addr<WebSocketSession>,
    live_ids: Vec<String>,  // All live_ids for this connection
}

struct LiveQueryRegistry {
    // Map: connection_id → ConnectedWebSocket
    connections: HashMap<String, ConnectedWebSocket>,
    
    // Map: live_id → connection_id (for reverse lookup)
    live_to_connection: HashMap<String, String>,
    
    // Current node identifier
    node_id: String,
}

// Live ID Format: connection_id + "-" + query_id
// Example: "conn_abc123-messages", "conn_abc123-notifications"
// 
// This format enables:
// - Unique identification across all nodes (connection_id is globally unique)
// - Client-friendly query_id extraction (split on last '-')
// - Easy cleanup on disconnect (all live_ids for a connection)

// On WebSocket connection:
// 1. Generate connection_id (UUID or snowflake ID)
// 2. Create WebSocketSession actor
// 3. Store: connections[connection_id] = ConnectedWebSocket { actor, live_ids: [] }

// On subscription registration (for each query with query_id):
// 1. Generate live_id = connection_id + "-" + query_id
// 2. Insert into system.live_queries (RocksDB) with live_id as key
// 3. Store: live_to_connection[live_id] = connection_id
// 4. Add live_id to connections[connection_id].live_ids

// On change detection:
// 1. Find matching live_ids from system.live_queries
// 2. Filter by node_id (only local subscriptions)
// 3. For each matching live_id:
//      - connection_id = live_to_connection[live_id]
//      - websocket = connections[connection_id]
//      - query_id = extract_query_id(live_id)  // Split on '-'
//      - Send message to websocket.actor with (query_id, change_data)
// 4. Increment changes counter in system.live_queries[live_id]

// On WebSocket disconnect:
// 1. websocket = connections[connection_id]
// 2. For each live_id in websocket.live_ids:
//      - Delete from system.live_queries (RocksDB)
//      - Remove from live_to_connection
// 3. Remove from connections
```

**Change Detection**:
- RocksDB writes trigger immediate notifications (< 50ms)
- Flush operations trigger batch notifications for persisted data
- Subscribers receive unified stream regardless of storage tier
- **Node-aware delivery**: Only the node that owns the WebSocket connection delivers notifications (prevents duplicate delivery in clustered deployments)
- **Query ID in notifications**: Clients receive query_id with each change notification so they know which subscription triggered the event

### RocksDB Column Family Architecture

RocksDB is used exclusively for **buffering table data** before flush to Parquet. Each table type has its own column family structure:

**Column Family Structure**:

1. **User Tables** - One column family per user table (shared by all users):
   ```
   Column Family Name: user_table:{namespace}:{table_name}
   
   Key Format: {user_id}:{row_id}
   Value: Serialized row data (Arrow RecordBatch or MessagePack)
   
   Example:
   CF: user_table:production:messages
   Keys:
     - user123:1234567890123456789 → {msg_id: ..., conversation_id: ..., content: ..., _updated: ..., _deleted: false}
     - user456:1234567890123456790 → {msg_id: ..., conversation_id: ..., content: ..., _updated: ..., _deleted: false}
     - user123:1234567890123456791 → {msg_id: ..., conversation_id: ..., content: ..., _updated: ..., _deleted: false}
   
   Flush Behavior:
   - When flush policy triggered (row limit or time interval)
   - Iterate through column family, group rows by user_id
   - For each user_id: write rows to separate Parquet file at ${user_id}/batch-*.parquet
   - After successful flush: delete flushed rows from RocksDB
   ```

2. **Shared Tables** - One column family per shared table:
   ```
   Column Family Name: shared_table:{namespace}:{table_name}
   
   Key Format: {row_id}
   Value: Serialized row data (Arrow RecordBatch or MessagePack)
   
   Example:
   CF: shared_table:production:conversations
   Keys:
     - 1234567890123456789 → {conversation_id: ..., created_at: ..., _updated: ..., _deleted: false}
     - 1234567890123456790 → {conversation_id: ..., created_at: ..., _updated: ..., _deleted: false}
   
   Flush Behavior:
   - When flush policy triggered
   - Read all buffered rows from column family
   - Write to single Parquet file at shared/{table_name}/batch-*.parquet
   - After successful flush: delete flushed rows from RocksDB
   ```

3. **Stream Tables** - One column family per stream table (shared by all users):
   ```
   Column Family Name: stream_table:{namespace}:{table_name}
   
   Key Format: {timestamp}:{row_id}  (timestamp for TTL ordering)
   Value: Serialized event data
   
   Example:
   CF: stream_table:production:ai_signals
   Keys:
     - 1697385600000:1234567890123456789 → {user_id: ..., event_type: 'ai_typing', payload: ...}
     - 1697385600001:1234567890123456790 → {user_id: ..., event_type: 'user_offline', payload: ...}
   
   Eviction Behavior:
   - TTL-based: Background job removes entries older than retention period
   - Max buffer: Evict oldest entries (lowest timestamp) when buffer full
   - Ephemeral mode: If no subscribers, discard immediately (no write to RocksDB)
   - NEVER flush to Parquet (ephemeral by design)
   ```

4. **System Tables** - One column family per system table:
   ```
   Column Family Name: system_table:{table_name}
   
   Example column families:
   - system_table:users (user_id → user data with username, metadata)
   - system_table:live_queries (live_id → subscription metadata)
   - system_table:storage_locations (location_name → location config)
   - system_table:jobs (job_id → job status, metrics, result, trace)
   
   Behavior:
   - No flush to Parquet (always in RocksDB for fast access)
   - No TTL or eviction (except jobs table with retention policy)
   - Direct read/write via SQL queries through DataFusion
   ```

5. **User Table Row Counters** - Single column family for all user-table row counters:
   ```
   Column Family Name: user_table_counters
   
   Key Format: {user_id}-{table_name}
   Value: 64-bit integer (current buffered row count for this user-table partition)
   
   Example:
   CF: user_table_counters
   Keys:
     - user123-messages → 8500  (user123 has 8,500 buffered messages)
     - user456-messages → 12000 (user456 has 12,000 buffered messages, flush triggered!)
     - user123-notifications → 450 (user123 has 450 buffered notifications)
   
   Behavior:
   - On INSERT: Increment counter for {user_id}-{table_name}
   - On DELETE (soft): No change to counter (row still buffered)
   - On Flush Policy Check: Compare counter against table's FLUSH POLICY ROWS threshold
   - On Flush Complete: Reset counter to 0 for that {user_id}-{table_name}
   - Enables per-user-per-table independent flush tracking
   ```

**Key Design Decisions**:

- ✅ **User tables**: Single column family for all users (efficient resource usage, simple management)
- ✅ **Key prefix with user_id**: Enables efficient iteration and grouping during flush
- ✅ **Stream tables**: Timestamp-prefixed keys for efficient TTL eviction
- ✅ **Shared tables**: No user_id prefix (global data, single Parquet file on flush)
- ✅ **Column families**: Isolated per table (different flush policies, independent operations)

**Memory and Resource Considerations**:

- Each column family has its own memtable and write buffer
- User tables with many users: Keys naturally distributed, efficient compaction
- Stream tables: Short-lived data, frequent eviction prevents unbounded growth
- System tables: Small size, always in memory for fast lookups

### System Tables Architecture

System tables (users, live_queries, storage_locations, jobs) use **RocksDB only**:

```
System Table Operations
    ↓
Read/Write directly to RocksDB
    ↓
No flush policies (always in hot storage)
    ↓
Optimized for low-latency admin queries
```

**Rationale**:
- System tables are typically small (metadata)
- Require fast access for catalog queries and monitoring
- No need for long-term archival in Parquet format

### System Tables Schema (Pre-defined by System)

**Current Schema Lookup**: Query `system.tables` for `current_schema_version`, then fetch from `system.table_schemas`

**System Table Creation**: All system tables are automatically created during server initialization. The system validates their existence and structure on every startup.

### Metadata Architecture (RocksDB-Only, No File System JSON)

**All server metadata (namespaces, tables, schemas, schema history) is persisted exclusively in RocksDB** to ensure the server can resume its state after restart. This eliminates file system JSON configuration files and simplifies the architecture.

### Unified SQL Engine for System Tables (kalamdb-sql Crate)

**Architecture Decision**: Instead of implementing separate CRUD logic for each system table, KalamDB uses a **unified SQL engine** that provides a single interface for all system table operations.

**Crate Structure** (Updated 2025-10-17):

**How It Works**:

1. **SQL Interface** - All system table operations use SQL syntax:
   ```rust
   // Instead of custom methods for each table:
   // namespace_service.create(name, options)
   // user_service.insert(user_id, username, metadata)
   
   // Unified SQL interface:
   kalamdb_sql::execute_system_query(
       "INSERT INTO system.namespaces (namespace_id, metadata) VALUES ('prod', '{}')",
       &rocksdb_handle
   )?;
   
   kalamdb_sql::execute_system_query(
       "SELECT * FROM system.users WHERE user_id = 'user123'",
       &rocksdb_handle
   )?;
   ```

2. **SQL Parsing** - Uses DataFusion's `sqlparser-rs`:
   ```rust
   // Parse SQL statement
   let stmt = sqlparser::parse("SELECT * FROM system.users WHERE user_id = ?");
   
   // Extract table name: "system.users"
   // Extract operation: SELECT
   // Extract filters: WHERE user_id = ?
   ```

3. **RocksDB Mapping** - Converts SQL to RocksDB operations:
   ```rust
   // SQL: INSERT INTO system.namespaces (namespace_id, metadata, created_at) VALUES (?, ?, ?)
   // → RocksDB: cf="system_namespaces", key="namespace_id", value=NamespaceRow{...}.to_json()
   
   // SQL: SELECT * FROM system.users WHERE user_id = 'user123'
   // → RocksDB: cf="system_users", key="user123", deserialize to UserRow
   
   // SQL: UPDATE system.tables SET current_schema_version = 2 WHERE table_id = 'prod:messages'
   // → RocksDB: cf="system_tables", key="prod:messages", update field, serialize back
   
   // SQL: DELETE FROM system.live_queries WHERE live_id = 'conn123-messages'
   // → RocksDB: cf="system_live_queries", key="conn123-messages", delete
   ```

4. **Rust Models** - Each system table has a typed struct:
   ```rust
   // models/namespace.rs
   #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
   pub struct NamespaceRow {
       pub namespace_id: String,
       pub metadata: Option<String>,  // JSON string
       pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
       pub updated_at: DateTime<Utc>,
   }
   
   // models/table.rs
   #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
   pub struct TableRow {
       pub table_id: String,  // "{namespace}:{table_name}"
       pub namespace_id: String,
       pub table_name: String,
       pub table_type: TableType,  // enum: USER, SHARED, STREAM
       pub current_schema_version: i32,
       pub storage_location: Option<String>,
       pub flush_policy: Option<String>,  // JSON string
       pub deleted_retention: Option<String>,
       pub stream_config: Option<String>,  // JSON string
       pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
       pub updated_at: DateTime<Utc>,
   }
   ```

**Benefits**:

✅ **No Code Duplication** - Single SQL engine for all system tables  
✅ **Consistent Interface** - Same SQL syntax for all CRUD operations  
✅ **Type Safety** - Rust models ensure correct serialization/deserialization  
✅ **Maintainability** - Add new system table = add model + column family mapping  
✅ **Testability** - Test SQL engine once, not per-table CRUD logic  
✅ **Familiar Syntax** - Developers use SQL instead of learning custom APIs  
✅ **DataFusion Integration** - Reuses existing SQL parsing infrastructure  
✅ **Future-Proof for Raft** - Designed to support replication via change events (see below)

**Future: Raft Consensus Integration (kalamdb-raft Crate)**

**Important Design Consideration**: While Raft-based replication is **not implemented in this phase**, kalamdb-sql is architecturally designed to support it in the future:

**Planned Architecture** (Future Enhancement):
```
kalamdb-sql (current phase)
  ↓
  Executes SQL on local RocksDB
  ↓
  [Future: Emit ChangeEvent for system table modifications]
  ↓
kalamdb-raft (future crate)
  ↓
  Listens to ChangeEvents from kalamdb-sql
  ↓
  Uses Raft consensus to replicate changes to cluster nodes
  ↓
  Other nodes apply same SQL via kalamdb-sql
  ↓
  All nodes have consistent system table state
```

**Future Change Event Model** (Preparatory Design):
```rust
// Future enhancement - not implemented in this phase
pub enum SystemTableChangeEvent {
    Insert { table: String, key: String, value: String, sql: String },
    Update { table: String, key: String, old_value: String, new_value: String, sql: String },
    Delete { table: String, key: String, sql: String },
}

// kalamdb-sql will be designed to optionally emit these events
// kalamdb-raft will subscribe to events and replicate via Raft protocol
```

**Why This Matters Now**:
1. **kalamdb-sql interface** should be stateless and idempotent (same SQL on any node produces same result)
2. **SQL statements** should be the replication unit (not raw RocksDB operations)
3. **Change events** can be added later without breaking existing API
4. **System tables** already designed as single source of truth for cluster metadata

**Example Future Replication Flow**:
```
Node 1: User executes "CREATE NAMESPACE production"
  ↓
Node 1: kalamdb-sql executes locally + emits ChangeEvent
  ↓
Node 1: kalamdb-raft receives event → proposes to Raft cluster
  ↓
Raft Consensus: Majority nodes agree → commit
  ↓
Node 2, 3: kalamdb-raft receives committed event → executes same SQL via kalamdb-sql
  ↓
All nodes: system.namespaces table now contains "production"
```

**Current Phase**: Focus on single-node kalamdb-sql implementation with clean SQL interface. Raft replication will be added in future phase as separate kalamdb-raft crate that builds on top of kalamdb-sql.

**Benefits of Three-Layer Architecture**:

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - kalamdb-sql: System metadata (SQL interface)
   - kalamdb-store: User data (K/V interface)
   - kalamdb-core: Business logic (orchestration)

2. **RocksDB Isolation**
   - Only kalamdb-sql and kalamdb-store import `rocksdb` crate
   - kalamdb-core has ZERO direct RocksDB coupling
   - Easy to test business logic without mocking RocksDB

3. **Simpler Dependencies**
   - kalamdb-core doesn't need to understand column family naming
   - kalamdb-core doesn't need to understand key encoding
   - kalamdb-core just calls clean APIs: `kalam_sql.get_user()` or `store.put()`

4. **Easier Testing**
   - Mock `KalamSql` interface for system table tests
   - Mock `UserTableStore` interface for data operation tests
   - No need to mock RocksDB in business logic tests

5. **Future Flexibility**
   - Can replace RocksDB with another K/V store in kalamdb-store only
   - Can add caching layer in kalamdb-store without touching kalamdb-core
   - Can add query optimization in kalamdb-sql without touching kalamdb-core

6. **Code Clarity**
   - Clear intent: "This uses kalamdb-sql" = system metadata operation
   - Clear intent: "This uses kalamdb-store" = user data operation
   - No confusion about which layer does what

**Migration Path** (Refactoring Tasks):

1. **Phase 1: Create kalamdb-store crate**
   - Extract K/V operations from user_table_insert/update/delete handlers
   - Implement UserTableStore, SharedTableStore, StreamTableStore
   - Add comprehensive tests

2. **Phase 2: Add scan_all methods to kalamdb-sql**
   - Add `scan_all_users()`, `scan_all_namespaces()`, etc.
   - Update adapter.rs with iterator-based scanning
   - Update lib.rs to expose scan methods

3. **Phase 3: Refactor system table providers**
   - Change constructor: `new(kalam_sql: Arc<KalamSql>)` 
   - Replace all `CatalogStore` usage with `kalam_sql` methods
   - Update tests to use `KalamSql` instead of `CatalogStore`

4. **Phase 4: Refactor user table handlers**
   - Change to use `UserTableStore` instead of direct RocksDB
   - Update user_table_insert.rs, user_table_update.rs, user_table_delete.rs
   - Remove RocksDB imports from these files

5. **Phase 5: Deprecate CatalogStore**
   - Mark `CatalogStore` as `#[deprecated]`
   - Add migration guide in documentation
   - Eventually remove in future version

**Current Status** (as of 2025-10-17):

- ✅ kalamdb-sql exists with basic CRUD for 7 system tables
- ⚠️ kalamdb-store does NOT exist yet (needs creation)
- ⚠️ kalamdb-core still uses CatalogStore (direct RocksDB)
- ⚠️ user_table_insert/update/delete have direct RocksDB imports
- ❌ scan_all methods missing from kalamdb-sql

**Priority**: This refactoring should be completed **before** moving to production but can be deferred after Phase 9 (user table operations) is complete.

pub fn create_namespace(namespace_id: &str, metadata: Option<String>) -> Result<()> {
    let sql = format!(
        "INSERT INTO system.namespaces (namespace_id, metadata, created_at, updated_at) 
         VALUES ('{}', {}, NOW(), NOW())",
        namespace_id,
        metadata.unwrap_or("null".to_string())
    );
    execute_system_query(&sql, &self.rocksdb)?;
    Ok(())
}

pub fn list_namespaces() -> Result<Vec<NamespaceRow>> {

        &self.rocksdb
    )?;
    Ok(result.into_iter().map(|row| row.into()).collect())
}
```

**RocksDB Column Families for Metadata**:
```
system_namespaces           # Namespace definitions
system_tables               # Table registry (all tables across all namespaces)
system_table_schemas        # Schema version history (Arrow schemas as JSON)
system_users                # User management
system_storage_locations    # Storage location registry
system_live_queries         # Active subscriptions
system_jobs                 # Job history and monitoring
user_table_counters         # Per-user-per-table row counters for flush policies
```

**Column Family to System Table Mapping**:
- `system.namespaces` → `system_namespaces` column family
- `system.tables` → `system_tables` column family
- `system.table_schemas` → `system_table_schemas` column family
- `system.users` → `system_users` column family
- `system.storage_locations` → `system_storage_locations` column family
- `system.live_queries` → `system_live_queries` column family
- `system.jobs` → `system_jobs` column family

**No File System Configuration** - All metadata operations:
- CREATE/ALTER/DROP NAMESPACE → `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE INTO system.namespaces` → RocksDB write
- CREATE/ALTER/DROP TABLE → `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE INTO system.tables` → RocksDB write
- Schema versioning → `INSERT INTO system.table_schemas` → RocksDB write (all versions retained)
- Server startup → `SELECT * FROM system.namespaces/tables/table_schemas` → load into in-memory catalog

**Example: Namespace Record in RocksDB** (`system_namespaces` column family):
```
Key: "production"
Value (JSON): {
  "namespace_id": "production",
  "metadata": "{\"retention_days\": 90, \"auto_flush\": true}",
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

**Example: Table Record in RocksDB** (`system_tables` column family):
```
Key: "production:messages"
Value (JSON): {
  "table_id": "production:messages",
  "namespace_id": "production",
  "table_name": "messages",
  "table_type": "USER",
  "current_schema_version": 2,
  "storage_location": "s3://bucket/users/${user_id}/messages/",
  "flush_policy": "{\"rows\": 10000}",
  "deleted_retention": "7d",
  "stream_config": null,
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-03-20T14:45:00Z"
}
```

**Example: Schema Version Record in RocksDB** (`system_table_schemas` column family):
```
Key: "production:messages:1"
Value (JSON): {
  "schema_id": "production:messages:1",
  "namespace_id": "production",
  "table_name": "messages",
  "version": 1,
  "arrow_schema": "{\"fields\": [{\"name\": \"id\", \"type\": {\"name\": \"int\", \"bitWidth\": 64}, \"nullable\": false}, ...]}",
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}

Key: "production:messages:2"
Value (JSON): {
  "schema_id": "production:messages:2",
  "namespace_id": "production",
  "table_name": "messages",
  "version": 2,
  "arrow_schema": "{\"fields\": [{\"name\": \"id\", \"type\": {\"name\": \"int\", \"bitWidth\": 64}, \"nullable\": false}, {\"name\": \"priority\", \"type\": {\"name\": \"utf8\"}, \"nullable\": true}, ...]}",
  "created_at": "2025-03-20T14:45:00Z"
}
```

**Schema Storage and Versioning**:

Each table schema is stored as a **versioned Arrow schema (JSON format)** in the `system_table_schemas` column family:

- **Versioning**: Each ALTER TABLE creates a new schema version (v1, v2, v3, ...)
- **History**: All versions retained in RocksDB for audit trail and potential rollback
- **Current Version**: Tracked in `system.tables.current_schema_version` field
- **Schema Lookup**:
  1. Query `system.tables` for table → get `current_schema_version`
  2. Query `system.table_schemas` with key `{namespace}:{table}:{version}` → get Arrow schema JSON
  3. Deserialize Arrow schema and load into DataFusion TableProvider

**Arrow Schema Format Example** (stored as JSON string in `arrow_schema` column):
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "table_options": {
    "flush_policy": {
      "type": "rows",
      "row_limit": 10000,
      "time_interval": null
    },
    "storage_location": "s3://bucket/users/${user_id}/messages/",
    "storage_location_reference": null,
    "deleted_retention": "7d",
    "auto_increment_field": "id"
  },
  "arrow_schema": {
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "id",
        "type": {"name": "int", "bitWidth": 64},
        "nullable": false,
        "metadata": {"auto_increment": "true"}
      },
      {
        "name": "conversation_id",
        "type": {"name": "utf8"},
        "nullable": false
      },
      {
        "name": "content",
        "type": {"name": "utf8"},
        "nullable": true
      },
      {
        "name": "_updated",
        "type": {"name": "timestamp", "unit": "MICROSECOND"},
        "nullable": false,
        "metadata": {"system_column": "true"}
      },
      {
        "name": "_deleted",
        "type": {"name": "bool"},
        "nullable": false,
        "metadata": {"system_column": "true"}
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Stream Table Schema File Example** (`schema_v1.json` for stream table):
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "created_at": "2025-03-10T12:15:00Z",
  "table_options": {
    "retention": "10s",
    "ephemeral": true,
    "max_buffer": 1000,
    "storage_location": null,
    "storage_location_reference": null
  },
  "arrow_schema": {
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "user_id",
        "type": {"name": "utf8"},
        "nullable": false
      },
      {
        "name": "event_type",
        "type": {"name": "utf8"},
        "nullable": false
      },
      {
        "name": "payload",
        "type": {"name": "utf8"},
        "nullable": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Metadata Persistence Requirements** (RocksDB-Only):

1. **Server Startup**: Load all metadata from RocksDB into in-memory structures
   - Load `system_namespaces` column family → populate in-memory namespace catalog
   - Load `system_tables` column family → register all tables in memory
   - Load `system_table_schemas` column family → cache current schema versions in memory
   - Load `system_storage_locations` column family → populate storage location registry
   - Load `system_users` column family → populate user catalog
   - **Memory-based catalog**: All metadata (namespaces, tables, schemas) kept in memory for fast access
   - **RocksDB usage**: For ALL metadata AND buffered table data (user/shared/stream table rows)

2. **Runtime Updates**: All metadata changes persist to RocksDB
   - CREATE NAMESPACE → write to `system_namespaces`, update in-memory catalog
   - ALTER NAMESPACE → update row in `system_namespaces`, update in-memory catalog
   - DROP NAMESPACE → delete from `system_namespaces` AND delete all related rows in `system_tables` and `system_table_schemas`, remove from memory
   - CREATE TABLE → write to `system_tables` AND write initial schema to `system_table_schemas` (version=1), register in memory
   - ALTER TABLE → write new schema version to `system_table_schemas`, update `current_schema_version` in `system_tables`, invalidate schema cache, reload in memory
   - DROP TABLE → delete from `system_tables` (schema history in `system_table_schemas` can be retained or deleted based on retention policy), remove from memory

3. **Atomic Updates**: RocksDB provides atomic writes via WriteBatch
   - Multi-row updates (e.g., DROP NAMESPACE affecting multiple tables) use WriteBatch for atomicity
   - Ensures server can always resume from last consistent state

4. **Storage Architecture**:
   - **In-Memory Catalog**: Namespaces, table metadata, schemas, storage locations (loaded from RocksDB on startup)
   - **RocksDB**: ALL metadata (namespaces, tables, schemas) AND system tables (users, storage_locations, live_queries, jobs) AND buffered table data (user/shared/stream table rows)
   - **No File System JSON**: All configuration persisted in RocksDB only
   - **Parquet Files**: Cold storage for user/shared table data after flush (data only, no metadata)
   - On startup: RocksDB → load all metadata into memory → server ready
   - On shutdown: In-memory catalog already persisted in RocksDB

**Schema Evolution Workflow**:
```
1. User executes ALTER TABLE command
    ↓
2. System validates schema compatibility (DataFusion projection)
    ↓
3. Write new schema version to RocksDB:
   - Key: "{namespace}:{table}:{N+1}"
   - Value: JSON with arrow_schema, version, created_at
    ↓
4. Update system.tables row:
   - Set current_schema_version = N+1
   - Set updated_at = NOW()
    ↓
5. Invalidate in-memory schema cache for this table
    ↓
6. DataFusion reloads schema from RocksDB for future queries
    ↓
7. Existing Parquet files remain with old schema
   (DataFusion handles projection automatically)
```

**Schema Loading**:
- **On table access**: Query `system.tables` (from memory cache) → get `current_schema_version` → query `system.table_schemas` (from RocksDB) → deserialize Arrow schema
- **DataFusion integration**: Arrow schema directly loaded into DataFusion TableProvider
- **Caching**: Table metadata and current schemas cached in memory, invalidated on ALTER TABLE
- **Backwards compatibility**: Old Parquet files read with schema projection (missing columns filled with NULL)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Arrow-native JSON format for DataFusion integration
- ✅ Versioning enables audit trail of schema changes (all versions in RocksDB)
- ✅ No file system I/O for schema operations
- ✅ Atomic updates via RocksDB WriteBatch
- ✅ Schema history queryable via system.table_schemas
- ✅ Future-proof for ALTER TABLE ADD/DROP/MODIFY COLUMN

### Flush Policy Enforcement

Flush policies determine **when data moves from RocksDB to Parquet**:

**Row-Based Flush Policy (Per-User-Per-Table)**:
```sql
CREATE USER TABLE messages (...)
FLUSH POLICY ROWS 10000;
```
- **Independent tracking**: Each user's partition of a table tracks rows separately
- **Counter storage**: RocksDB column family `user_table_counters` with key `{user_id}-{table_name}` → counter value
- **On INSERT**: Increment counter in `user_table_counters` (e.g., `user123-messages` = current + 1)
- **Flush trigger**: When counter reaches threshold (10000) → trigger flush job for that specific user-table partition
- **Flush scope**: Only rows for that user_id are flushed to Parquet (e.g., `user123/messages/batch-*.parquet`)
- **Counter reset**: After successful flush, reset counter to 0 for that `{user_id}-{table_name}`
- **Independence**: user123's messages at 8K rows does NOT trigger flush; user456's messages at 12K rows DOES trigger flush (only for user456)

**Example**:
```
Table: messages with FLUSH POLICY ROWS 10000

user_table_counters column family:
- user123-messages → 8500  (no flush yet)
- user456-messages → 12000 (flush triggered! writes user456's rows to user456/messages/batch-001.parquet)
- user789-messages → 500   (no flush yet)

After user456 flush completes:
- user456-messages → 0 (counter reset)
```

**Time-Based Flush Policy**:
```sql
CREATE USER TABLE logs (...)
FLUSH POLICY INTERVAL '5 minutes';
```
- Background scheduler triggers flush every N seconds/minutes
- Flushes all buffered data regardless of row count
- Ensures data persisted within predictable time window

**Combined Policy** (flush on whichever condition met first):
```sql
CREATE USER TABLE metrics (...)
FLUSH POLICY ROWS 5000 INTERVAL '1 minute';
```

### Resource Management

**RocksDB Buffer Management**:
- Configurable memory limit per table/namespace
- LRU eviction for memory pressure (rare, typically flush first)
- WAL (Write-Ahead Log) for crash recovery

**Flush Job Execution**:
- Concurrent flush jobs allowed (different tables/users)
- Resource tracking: CPU, memory, bytes written
- Recorded in system.jobs table for monitoring

**Storage Backend Interaction**:
- S3: Async uploads, retry logic, credential management
- Filesystem: Direct writes, configurable paths
- Error handling: Failed flushes recorded in system.jobs with partial metrics

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-17

- Q: Should system.storage_locations be stored in RocksDB only (like other system tables), JSON config files only, or both? → A: RocksDB only (system table) - consistent with other system tables, runtime updates
- Q: Should the spec include schema documentation for all 4 pre-defined system tables? → A: Yes - Add schema documentation for all 4 pre-defined system tables (also: users table gets metadata field, remove email field)
- Q: Should deleted_retention policy apply per-table, per-namespace, or globally? → A: Per-table - Each table specifies its own deleted_retention in CREATE TABLE
- Q: Should flush policy row counters be per-table (all users combined), per-user-per-table (independent), or configurable? → A: Per-user per-table - Each user's partition tracks rows independently (store counters in separate RocksDB column family 'user-table-counters' with key format: {user_id}-{table_name})
- Q: Should live query subscriptions on user tables span multiple users or be limited to current user? → A: Single-user scope - Implicit user_id filter (user can only subscribe to their own partition)
- Q: Should namespaces and table schemas be stored in JSON files on disk or in RocksDB? → A: RocksDB only - Store namespaces, table schemas, and schema history in RocksDB column families (eliminate all file system JSON configuration)
- Q: Should system tables have individual CRUD implementations or use a unified SQL engine? → A: Unified SQL engine - Create kalamdb-sql crate that provides SQL interface to all system tables, converts SQL to RocksDB column family operations, eliminates duplicate logic
- Q: Should kalamdb-sql be designed with future Raft replication in mind? → A: Yes - kalamdb-sql should emit change events for system table modifications to enable future kalamdb-raft crate to replicate changes across cluster nodes (not implemented in this phase, but architecture prepared)
- Q: Should RocksDB dependency be isolated to specific crates or spread across kalamdb-core? → A: Three-layer architecture - (1) kalamdb-sql: System tables with SQL interface and RocksDB, (2) kalamdb-store: User/Shared/Stream table K/V operations with RocksDB, (3) kalamdb-core: Business logic only, no direct RocksDB imports
- Q: Should user table INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations use CatalogStore or a dedicated K/V store? → A: Create kalamdb-store crate for user table K/V operations (put/get/delete with UserId-scoped keys), eliminate CatalogStore direct usage in providers, all system table operations go through kalamdb-sql only

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 0 - REST API and WebSocket Interface (Priority: P1)

A developer wants to interact with KalamDB through a simple HTTP REST API for executing SQL commands, and WebSocket connections for live query subscriptions with initial data fetch and real-time updates.

**Why this priority**: REST API and WebSocket are the fundamental interfaces for all database interactions. Without them, no other features can be accessed.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sending SQL commands via POST request and establishing WebSocket connections with multiple query subscriptions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have database access, **When** I send a POST request to `/api/sql` with a single SQL statement, **Then** I receive query results or success confirmation in JSON format
2. **Given** I want to execute multiple commands, **When** I send a POST request with multiple SQL statements separated by semicolons, **Then** all commands execute in sequence and I receive results for each
3. **Given** I want live updates, **When** I establish WebSocket connection with an array of subscription queries, **Then** the connection is accepted and I receive initial data for each query
4. **Given** I have an active WebSocket subscription, **When** I specify "last N rows" in my query options, **Then** I receive the last N rows immediately upon connection
5. **Given** I have a WebSocket subscription, **When** data changes (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) match my filter, **Then** I receive real-time change notifications with change type
6. **Given** I have multiple queries in one WebSocket connection, **When** changes occur, **Then** I receive notifications for all matching subscriptions
7. **Given** I send malformed SQL via REST API, **Then** I receive clear error messages with HTTP 400 status
8. **Given** I have a WebSocket subscription, **When** rows are deleted (soft delete), **Then** I receive DELETE notifications with the deleted row data

---

### User Story 1 - Namespace Management (Priority: P1)

A database administrator wants to organize their database into logical namespaces. They need to create, list, edit, drop namespaces, and configure namespace-specific options. Namespaces are stored exclusively in RocksDB (`system_namespaces` column family), not in file system JSON files.

**Why this priority**: Namespaces are the foundational organizational structure. Without them, no tables can exist.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a namespace, listing it, editing its options, and verifying it appears in the catalog. Delivers the core organizational capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have database access, **When** I create a namespace named "production", **Then** the namespace is created in RocksDB `system_namespaces` and appears in the namespace list
2. **Given** a namespace "production" exists, **When** I list all namespaces, **Then** I see "production" with its metadata from system_namespaces (creation date, metadata JSON)
3. **Given** a namespace "production" exists, **When** I edit the namespace to add options, **Then** the metadata field in system_namespaces is updated with the new options (JSON string)
4. **Given** a namespace "production" has no tables, **When** I drop the namespace, **Then** the namespace is deleted from system_namespaces RocksDB column family
5. **Given** a namespace "production" has tables, **When** I attempt to drop it, **Then** the system queries system_tables to check for dependencies and prevents deletion showing which tables exist

---

### User Story 2 - System Tables and User Management (Priority: P1)

A database administrator wants to manage users through a system table for basic user tracking and identification.

**Why this priority**: User management provides basic user identification needed for user-scoped tables and tracking.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding users to the system table and querying user information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a database administrator, **When** I add a user to the system users table, **Then** the user is created with user_id, username, and optional metadata (JSON)
2. **Given** users exist in the system, **When** I query the system.users table, **Then** I see all registered users with their user_id, username, metadata, created_at, and updated_at
3. **Given** I want to store custom user data, **When** I insert a user with metadata='{"role": "admin", "preferences": {...}}', **Then** the metadata is stored as JSON string in the metadata column
4. **Given** I want to track the current user, **When** I use CURRENT_USER() in a query, **Then** it returns the authenticated user's ID

**Note**: Row-level permissions and access control on shared tables will be implemented in a future version using VIEWs. Each user will have their own VIEW of shared tables containing only rowid references, updated automatically on writes to RocksDB.

---

### User Story 2a - Live Query Monitoring via System Table (Priority: P1)

A database administrator or user wants to monitor active live query subscriptions in the system. They need to view all active subscriptions including connection details, change tracking, query information, and ability to kill any live query. The system supports multiple subscriptions per WebSocket connection and node-aware routing for cluster deployments.

**Why this priority**: Visibility into active subscriptions is critical for monitoring, debugging, and resource management with killing/freeing the queries

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating live subscriptions and querying the system.live_queries table to verify all subscription details are visible.

**System Architecture**:
- Each WebSocket connection gets a unique `connection_id` (generated on connect)
- Each WebSocket connection can have **multiple live query subscriptions** (client provides `query_id` for each)
- **Live ID format**: `live_id = connection_id + "-" + query_id` (e.g., "conn_abc123-messages")
- **In-memory registry** maintains:
  - `HashMap<connection_id, ConnectedWebSocket>` where ConnectedWebSocket has actor address and list of live_ids
  - `HashMap<live_id, connection_id>` for reverse lookup during change detection
- **Node-aware delivery**: `node` field identifies which node owns the WebSocket connection
- **Change counter**: `changes` field tracks total notifications delivered per subscription
- **Options storage**: `options` field stores JSON-encoded LiveQueryOptions (e.g., `{"last_rows": 50}`)
- Subscriptions are stored in `system.live_queries` column family with key format: `{live_id}` (composite format: `{user_id}-{unique_conn_id}-{table_id}-{query_id}`)

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has an active live query subscription, **When** I query `SELECT * FROM system.live_queries`, **Then** I see the subscription with live_id, connection_id, table_id, query_id, user_id, query text, options (JSON), created_at, updated_at, changes count, and node identifier
2. **Given** a user opens one WebSocket connection with 3 subscription queries (query_ids: "messages", "notifications", "alerts") targeting different tables, **When** I query system.live_queries, **Then** I see 3 separate rows all with the same connection_id but different live_ids (e.g., "user123-conn_abc-messages-messages", "user123-conn_abc-notifications-notifications", "user123-conn_abc-alerts-alerts")
3. **Given** a subscription specifies options with `last_rows: 50`, **When** I query system.live_queries, **Then** I see the options field containing `{"last_rows": 50}`
4. **Given** multiple users have active subscriptions, **When** I filter `SELECT * FROM system.live_queries WHERE user_id = 'user123'`, **Then** I see only subscriptions for that user
5. **Given** a subscription is actively streaming data, **When** I query the live_queries table, **Then** I see the changes counter incrementing and updated_at timestamp reflecting the last notification
6. **Given** a subscription disconnects, **When** I query the live_queries table, **Then** all live_ids for that connection_id are automatically removed from the table
7. **Given** a cluster with nodeA and nodeB, **When** a user's WebSocket is connected to nodeB, **Then** the subscription rows show node='nodeB'
8. **Given** a data change occurs in nodeA, **When** the system detects matching subscriptions, **Then** only subscriptions with node='nodeA' are notified locally (nodeB subscriptions are skipped)
9. **Given** I want to kill a specific subscription, **When** I execute `KILL LIVE QUERY live_id`, **Then** the subscription is disconnected and removed from the table

---

### User Story 2b - Storage Location Management via System Table (Priority: P1)

A database administrator wants to predefine and manage storage locations through a RocksDB system table. When creating tables, users can reference these predefined locations instead of specifying full location strings. Storage locations are persisted exclusively in RocksDB (no JSON configuration file) for consistency with other system tables and to enable runtime updates.

**Why this priority**: Centralized storage location management simplifies table creation and ensures consistency across tables.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding storage locations to the system table, then creating tables that reference these locations by name.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a database administrator, **When** I add a storage location to `system.storage_locations` RocksDB table with name "s3-prod" and path "s3://prod-bucket/data/", **Then** the location is registered in RocksDB and loaded into memory
2. **Given** a storage location "s3-prod" exists in RocksDB, **When** I create a table with `LOCATION REFERENCE 's3-prod'`, **Then** the table uses the predefined location from the in-memory registry
3. **Given** a storage location is referenced by tables, **When** I query `SELECT * FROM system.storage_locations`, **Then** I see usage count and which tables reference it (queried from RocksDB)
4. **Given** I want to update a storage location, **When** I modify the system.storage_locations RocksDB entry, **Then** the in-memory registry is updated immediately, existing tables continue using the old path but new tables use the updated path
5. **Given** a storage location is in use, **When** I attempt to delete it from system.storage_locations, **Then** the system prevents deletion and shows dependent tables

---

### User Story 2c - Job Monitoring via System Table (Priority: P1)

A database administrator wants to monitor active and historical jobs (flush operations, cleanup tasks, scheduled jobs, etc.) through a system table. They need to view when jobs started and completed, job results/traces, resource usage (memory/CPU), execution parameters, and which node executed the job.

**Why this priority**: Visibility into all system jobs is critical for performance monitoring, debugging, and capacity planning across all operational tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering various jobs (flush operations, cleanup tasks, scheduled jobs), querying the system.jobs table, and verifying all job details are recorded.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a job starts (flush, cleanup, or scheduled task), **When** I query `SELECT * FROM system.jobs`, **Then** I see the job with status='running', start_time, job_type, parameters, and node_id

### User Story 3 - User Table Creation and Management (Priority: P1)

A developer wants to create user-scoped tables where each user has their own isolated table instance. They need to define the table schema with auto-increment fields, specify storage locations with user ID templates, and configure flush policies. The system automatically adds tracking columns for change detection and soft deletes.

**Why this priority**: User tables are the core data model for isolated, per-user data storage. Essential for multi-tenant scenarios.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a user table definition, inserting data for different users, and verifying data isolation per user ID.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am in namespace "production", **When** I create a user table "messages" with schema (message_id BIGINT, content STRING), **Then** the table definition is created with automatic system columns (_updated TIMESTAMP, _deleted BOOLEAN)
2. **Given** I create a user table "messages", **When** I specify a storage location with user ID template like `s3://bucket/users/${user_id}/messages/`, **Then** each user's data is stored in their own path
3. **Given** I create a user table, **When** I don't specify an auto-increment field, **Then** the system automatically adds a snowflake ID field
4. **Given** a user table "messages" exists, **When** user "user123" inserts data, **Then** the data is stored with _updated = NOW() and _deleted = false at the user-specific location
5. **Given** a user table "messages" exists, **When** I query data for user "user123", **Then** I only see data belonging to that user where _deleted = false
6. **Given** I create a user table with FLUSH POLICY ROWS 10000, **When** user123 inserts 12000 rows, **Then** only user123's data is flushed to disk (other users' data remains buffered independently)
7. **Given** I create a user table, **When** I specify a flush policy with time interval, **Then** data is flushed to disk at the specified intervals (all buffered data for all users)
8. **Given** I have user table "messages" with FLUSH POLICY ROWS 10000, **When** I query the user_table_counters, **Then** I see separate counters for each user (e.g., user123-messages, user456-messages)
9. **Given** I create a user table with per-table deleted_retention option, **When** I set deleted_retention='7d', **Then** soft-deleted rows in that specific table are kept for 7 days before physical removal (independent of other tables)
10. **Given** a user table has deleted_retention='off', **When** rows are soft-deleted, **Then** they are never physically removed in that table (kept indefinitely)

---

### User Story 3a - Table Deletion and Cleanup (Priority: P1)

A developer wants to drop (delete) user tables and shared tables they no longer need. The system must clean up all associated data including RocksDB buffers, Parquet files, and metadata.

**Why this priority**: Table lifecycle management is essential for production use. Users need ability to remove obsolete tables and reclaim storage.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a table, inserting data, dropping the table, and verifying all data and metadata is removed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user table "messages" exists with no active subscriptions, **When** I execute DROP TABLE messages, **Then** the table is deleted and all associated data is removed
2. **Given** a user table has buffered data in RocksDB, **When** I drop the table, **Then** both RocksDB buffer and Parquet files are deleted
3. **Given** a user table has data across multiple user IDs, **When** I drop the table, **Then** all user-specific Parquet files are deleted from storage
4. **Given** a shared table exists, **When** I drop the table, **Then** the shared table data and metadata are removed
5. **Given** a table has active live query subscriptions, **When** I attempt to drop the table, **Then** the system prevents deletion and shows active subscription count
6. **Given** I drop a table, **When** I query the catalog, **Then** the table no longer appears in the table list
7. **Given** a table is dropped, **When** I try to query it, **Then** I receive "table not found" error
8. **Given** a table is dropped, **When** I create a new table with the same name, **Then** the new table is created successfully without conflicts

---

### User Story 3b - Table Schema Evolution (ALTER TABLE) (Priority: P2)

A developer wants to modify table schemas after they have been created and contain data. They need to add new columns, remove unused columns, or modify column types as application requirements evolve. The system must preserve existing data and maintain backwards compatibility with old Parquet files.

**Why this priority**: Schema evolution is essential for long-lived applications. Requirements change over time, and forcing developers to recreate tables with data migration is costly.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a table, inserting data, altering the schema (add/drop/modify columns), and verifying queries work correctly with both old and new data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user table "messages" exists with data, **When** I execute ALTER TABLE messages ADD COLUMN priority STRING, **Then** the new column is added and existing rows have NULL for the new column
2. **Given** I add a column with DEFAULT value, **When** querying old data, **Then** the default value is used for rows created before the schema change
3. **Given** a table has multiple schema versions, **When** I query the table, **Then** DataFusion merges data from all Parquet files using schema projection
4. **Given** a column is referenced in an active live query subscription, **When** I attempt to drop that column, **Then** the system prevents the change and shows which subscriptions reference it
5. **Given** I modify a column type, **When** the change is incompatible (e.g., STRING to INT), **Then** the system rejects the change with validation error
6. **Given** I execute ALTER TABLE, **When** the operation succeeds, **Then** a new schema version file is created and manifest.json is updated
7. **Given** a table has schema version 3, **When** I run DESCRIBE TABLE, **Then** I see current version, schema history, and paths to schema files
8. **Given** I attempt to alter a stream table, **When** I execute ALTER TABLE, **Then** the system rejects the operation (stream tables have immutable schemas)
9. **Given** I attempt to alter a system column (_updated, _deleted), **When** I execute ALTER TABLE, **Then** the system rejects the operation

---

### User Story 4a - Stream Table Creation for Ephemeral Events (Priority: P1)

A developer wants to create stream tables for ephemeral, transient events that don't need persistence. These tables handle real-time events like "AI is typing", "user went offline", or other state changes that should be delivered to subscribers but not stored permanently on disk.

**Why this priority**: Stream tables enable real-time event delivery without the overhead of disk persistence, crucial for responsive chat applications and live status updates.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a stream table, publishing events to it, subscribing to the stream, and verifying events are delivered but not persisted to disk/S3.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am in namespace "production", **When** I create a stream table "ai_signals" with retention='10s' and ephemeral=true, **Then** the stream table is created and does not persist data to disk
2. **Given** a stream table "ai_signals" exists, **When** I insert an event with event_type='ai_typing', **Then** the event is buffered in memory/RocksDB hot storage only
3. **Given** a stream table has retention='10s', **When** an event is older than 10 seconds, **Then** the event is automatically removed from the buffer
4. **Given** a stream table has max_buffer=1000, **When** the buffer reaches 1000 events, **Then** the oldest events are evicted to make room for new ones
5. **Given** a stream table has ephemeral=true, **When** there are no active subscribers, **Then** new events are immediately discarded without buffering
6. **Given** a stream table has ephemeral=false, **When** there are no active subscribers, **Then** events are buffered up to max_buffer limit for future subscribers
7. **Given** a user subscribes to a stream table, **When** events are inserted, **Then** the subscriber receives events in real-time without disk I/O
8. **Given** a stream table "ai_signals" exists, **When** I query its schema, **Then** I see it marked as type=STREAM with its retention and buffer configuration

---

### User Story 5 - Shared Table Creation and Management (Priority: P1)

A developer wants to create shared tables that are accessible across all users within a namespace. These tables store global configuration, lookup data, or cross-user information with optional flush policies.

**Why this priority**: Shared tables complement user tables by providing global data storage. Both are needed for a complete data model.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a shared table, inserting data from different users, and verifying all users can access the same data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am in namespace "production", **When** I create a shared table "conversations" with schema (conversation_id STRING, created_at TIMESTAMP), **Then** the table is created as a shared resource
2. **Given** a shared table "conversations" exists, **When** any user inserts data, **Then** the data is visible to all users in the namespace
3. **Given** a shared table exists, **When** I specify a storage location, **Then** all data is stored at that single location (no user ID templating)
4. **Given** I create a shared table, **When** I query from different users, **Then** all users see the same complete dataset
5. **Given** I create a shared table, **When** I specify a flush policy, **Then** data is flushed according to the policy (row-based or time-based)

**Note**: Fine-grained row-level access control on shared tables will be implemented in a future version using VIEWs. Each user will have their own VIEW of shared tables with filtered rowid references.

---

### User Story 6 - Live Query Subscriptions with Change Tracking (Priority: P2)

A user wants to subscribe to real-time changes on their user table or stream table with filtered queries using WebSocket connections. The live query subscription automatically tracks and delivers all data changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) matching the subscription filter, eliminating the need for a separate Change Data Capture (CDC) mechanism.

**Why this priority**: Live queries with built-in change tracking enable real-time applications. The WebSocket-based subscription mechanism inherently provides CDC functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by subscribing to a filtered query via WebSocket, performing insert/update/delete operations, and verifying the subscriber receives all change notifications with correct change types.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user "user123" has a user table "messages", **When** they subscribe to `SELECT * FROM messages WHERE conversation_id = 'conv456'`, **Then** the subscription is created with implicit `user_id = 'user123'` filter (only their own data)
2. **Given** user "user123" subscribes to user table "messages", **When** user "user456" inserts a message, **Then** user123 does NOT receive any notification (different user partition)
3. **Given** user "user123" subscribes to shared table "conversations", **When** any user creates a conversation, **Then** user123 receives INSERT notification (shared tables have no implicit user_id filter)
4. **Given** a subscription exists for conversation_id = 'conv456', **When** a message with that conversation_id is inserted by the same user, **Then** the subscriber receives an INSERT notification with the new row
5. **Given** a subscription exists, **When** a matching row is updated, **Then** the subscriber receives an UPDATE notification with old and new row values
6. **Given** a subscription exists, **When** a matching row is deleted, **Then** the subscriber receives a DELETE notification with the deleted row data
7. **Given** a subscription exists, **When** data not matching the filter is changed, **Then** the subscriber does not receive any notification
8. **Given** multiple subscriptions exist for the same user, **When** data is changed, **Then** only matching subscriptions receive notifications
9. **Given** a subscription is active, **When** the subscriber disconnects, **Then** the subscription is cleaned up automatically

---

### User Story 7 - Namespace Backup and Restore (Priority: P3)

A database administrator wants to backup entire namespaces including all tables, schemas, and data. They need a simple command to create backups and restore them later.

**Why this priority**: Backup is critical for production but can be implemented after core functionality is stable.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by backing up a namespace, dropping it, restoring from backup, and verifying all data is recovered.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a namespace "production" with multiple tables, **When** I execute a backup command, **Then** all namespace metadata and table data is backed up to a specified location
2. **Given** a backup exists, **When** I restore the namespace, **Then** all tables and data are recreated exactly as they were
3. **Given** I want incremental backups, **When** I execute a backup with incremental flag, **Then** only changes since last backup are saved
4. **Given** a backup file exists, **When** I list backup contents, **Then** I see all tables and metadata without restoring

---

### User Story 8 - Table and Namespace Catalog Browsing (Priority: P2)

A user wants to browse and inspect their database structure just like in traditional SQL servers. They need to list namespaces, view tables within namespaces, and inspect table schemas.

**Why this priority**: Discovery and introspection are essential for usability but follow after basic creation capabilities.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating namespaces and tables, then using catalog queries to list and inspect them.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple namespaces exist, **When** I query the system catalog for namespaces, **Then** I see all namespaces with their metadata
2. **Given** I am in namespace "production", **When** I list tables, **Then** I see user tables, shared tables, and system tables with their types indicated
3. **Given** a table "messages" exists, **When** I describe the table, **Then** I see all columns with their types, which is the auto-increment field, storage location, and flush policy
4. **Given** a user table exists, **When** I query table statistics, **Then** I see row counts per user ID or aggregate statistics

- Regex-based permissions are evaluated at query planning time, not at runtime
- System users table is protected and only accessible by administrators
- Backup/restore operations are performed during maintenance windows or low-traffic periods
- Namespace options structure will be defined during implementation phase
- Table schemas are defined at creation time and do not require dynamic schema evolution initially

- Stream table retention periods are short-lived (seconds to minutes, not hours/days)
- RocksDB or in-memory storage has sufficient capacity for max_buffer limits across all stream tables
- Stream table events do not require ACID guarantees or persistence
- Job metrics collection has minimal performance overhead (< 5%)
- System can accurately measure memory and CPU usage per job execution
- Job history retention policies are configurable per deployment
- Node_id for jobs can be determined from system context (single-node or cluster ID)

- Snowflake ID generator library or implementation
- RocksDB store for namespace/table catalog, system tables, and buffered writes
- File system access for local storage backend
- WebSocket protocol for live query subscriptions (provides real-time change notifications for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
- WebSocket must support multiple subscriptions per connection with independent filtering
- WebSocket must support initial data fetch ("last N rows") upon subscription establishment
- Template engine for ${user_id} path substitution

## Out of Scope
- Cross-namespace queries or data access

- Advanced storage features like versioning, snapshots, or point-in-time recovery beyond basic backup
- Complex permission expressions beyond column filters and regex patterns (e.g., JOIN-based permissions)
- Role-based access control (RBAC) hierarchy - only direct user permissions
- Storage cost optimization or tiering automation
- Table partitioning strategies
- Incremental backup implementation (syntax reserved, implementation deferred)
- Live query subscriptions on shared tables (user tables only)
- Query optimization and performance tuning beyond basic DataFusion capabilities
- Transaction support and ACID guarantees beyond DataFusion's capabilities
- Data compression algorithm selection (use Parquet defaults)
- Audit logging of permission checks and data access
- Dynamic permission updates without system restart
- Permission inheritance or delegation mechanisms
- Hard delete operations (physical row removal on DELETE command)
- Automatic compaction of Parquet files with soft-deleted rows
- Additional REST API endpoints beyond `/api/sql` (keeping it simple with single endpoint)
- Separate WebSocket endpoints for different query types (single `/ws` endpoint handles all subscriptions)

## Future Considerations

### Table Export Functionality

**Note**: Table export is **NOT** part of the current feature scope. It is documented here for future implementation.

**Export Feature Overview**:

Users may need to export data from tables to files for backup, migration, or external processing using simple SQL-like syntax.

**Proposed Capabilities**:
- Export entire user tables: `EXPORT FROM messages TO 'backup.parquet'`
- Export shared tables: `EXPORT FROM conversations TO 'conversations.parquet'`
- Export query results: `EXPORT FROM (SELECT * FROM messages WHERE created_at > '2025-01-01') TO 'recent.parquet'`
- Support multiple formats: Parquet (default), CSV, JSON
- Respect user permissions during export operations
- Provide export confirmation with row count and file size

**Why defer this?**: Export functionality adds complexity around file handling, format conversion, and permission enforcement across potentially large datasets. The core database operations (CRUD, queries, live subscriptions) should be stable first. Users can achieve similar results by querying data through the API and saving results client-side.

**Implementation Considerations** (for future work):
- Streaming export for large datasets to avoid memory issues
- Parallel export for user tables across multiple user partitions
- Progress tracking for long-running exports
- Handling file path conflicts and storage quota limits
- Support for compressed export formats
- Incremental export capabilities

### Distributed Replication with Raft Consensus

**Note**: The following distributed replication architecture is **NOT** part of the current feature scope. It is documented here for future planning and to guide the architectural design to ensure compatibility when distribution is added later.

**Raft-based Distribution Model**:

KalamDB can implement distributed replication using the Raft consensus protocol to provide strong consistency guarantees across multiple nodes. The proposed architecture includes:

1. **Write Operations Flow**:
   - Client writes to the Raft leader node
   - Leader receives the write request and logs it
   - Leader replicates the change to all follower nodes in the Raft group
   - Leader waits for acknowledgment from a majority (quorum) of nodes
   - Only after quorum acknowledgment, leader returns success to client API call
   - Ensures strong consistency: all committed writes are durable across majority

2. **Raft Group Leadership**:
   - Raft group elects a single leader node
   - Leader is responsible for coordinating writes and flush operations
   - Leader orchestrates flushing buffered data from RocksDB to disk/S3 storage
   - Followers replicate leader's state machine and can serve read requests
   - Automatic leader election on failure for high availability

3. **Benefits**:
   - **Strong Consistency**: Linearizable writes across distributed nodes
   - **Durability**: Data replicated to multiple nodes before acknowledgment
   - **Fault Tolerance**: System continues operating with leader failure (automatic re-election)
   - **No Split Brain**: Raft's quorum-based approach prevents split-brain scenarios

4. **Implementation Considerations** (for future work):
   - Raft library integration (e.g., tikv/raft-rs for Rust)
   - Log replication mechanism between nodes
   - Snapshot management for state machine recovery
   - Read-after-write consistency guarantees
   - Network partition handling and quorum management
   - Performance impact of synchronous replication on write latency

**Why defer this?**: Distributed consensus adds significant complexity. The current architecture focuses on foundational capabilities (namespaces, tables, permissions, live queries) with single-node or simple async replication. Raft-based distribution should be added once core functionality is proven and scalability requirements demand strong consistency across distributed nodes.

**Design Compatibility**: The current architecture's separation of concerns (RocksDB for buffered writes, Parquet for storage, flush policies) naturally aligns with a future Raft implementation where the leader coordinates these operations across replicas.

### Deleted Row Retention and Cleanup Jobs

**Note**: The following deleted row cleanup implementation is **NOT** part of the current feature scope. It is documented here for future implementation.

**Deleted Row Cleanup Feature Overview**:

User and shared tables use soft deletes (_deleted = true) to support change tracking and "changes since timestamp" queries. However, soft-deleted rows accumulate over time and need periodic cleanup based on retention policies.

**Proposed Capabilities**:

1. **Retention Policy Configuration**:
   ```sql
   CREATE USER TABLE messages (...)
   WITH (deleted_retention = '7d');  -- Keep deleted rows for 7 days
   
   CREATE USER TABLE logs (...)
   WITH (deleted_retention = 'off');  -- Never cleanup deleted rows
   ```

2. **Automated Cleanup Jobs**:
   - Background scheduler runs cleanup jobs based on table retention policies
   - Jobs scan for rows where _deleted = true AND _updated < (NOW() - retention_period)
   - Physical removal of eligible soft-deleted rows from both RocksDB and Parquet
   - Cleanup jobs appear in system.jobs table with job_type='cleanup_deleted'

3. **Cleanup Job Execution**:
   ```sql
   -- View active cleanup jobs
   SELECT * FROM system.jobs 
   WHERE job_type = 'cleanup_deleted' AND status = 'running';
   
   -- Cleanup job details
   {
     job_id: "cleanup_12345",
     job_type: "cleanup_deleted",
     table_name: "messages",
     namespace: "production",
     user_id: "user123",  -- for user tables
     status: "running",
     parameters: ["retention_period=7d", "threshold_timestamp=2025-10-08T00:00:00Z"],
     result: "rows_removed: 1543, bytes_freed: 45MB",
     trace: "node-01, cleanup scheduler",
     start_time: "2025-10-15T10:00:00Z",
     end_time: "2025-10-15T10:05:23Z"
   }
   ```

4. **Implementation Considerations** (for future work):
   - Cleanup jobs must not interfere with active queries or live subscriptions
   - Parquet file rewriting required to physically remove deleted rows (compaction)
   - RocksDB tombstone cleanup for deleted rows
   - Transaction coordination to ensure consistency during cleanup
   - Progress tracking for long-running cleanup operations on large tables
   - Configurable cleanup schedule (e.g., daily, weekly)
   - Resource limits for cleanup jobs (max memory, max duration)

**Why defer this?**: Implementing physical deletion with Parquet file compaction adds complexity around concurrent access, transaction management, and resource control. The soft delete mechanism provides all core functionality (change tracking, CDC, data isolation). Cleanup can be added later when storage optimization becomes a priority.

**User Workaround**: Until cleanup jobs are implemented, users can:
- Query soft-deleted rows explicitly if needed: `SELECT * FROM table WHERE _deleted = true`
- Set deleted_retention='off' to retain all deleted rows indefinitely
- Manually manage storage if soft-deleted rows accumulate significantly

### Distributed Cluster Architecture with Specialized Nodes

**Note**: The following distributed cluster architecture is **NOT** part of the current feature scope. It is documented here for future planning.

**Cluster Node Types**:

KalamDB can implement a distributed cluster with two specialized node types, each optimized for different workloads:

1. **Database Server Replica Nodes** (`database-server-replica`):
   - Full-featured database nodes with REST API, core engine, and storage
   - Can handle write operations and buffer data in RocksDB
   - Persist data to disk/S3 storage
   - Participate in data replication and fault tolerance
   - Handle both CRUD operations and live query subscriptions
   - Run flush operations to convert buffered data to Parquet
   - Suitable for: Primary write workloads, data durability, backup operations

2. **Live Query Nodes** (`live-query`):
   - Specialized nodes for serving live WebSocket connections only
   - Do NOT persist data to disk (ephemeral, stateless)
   - Handle high volumes of concurrent WebSocket subscriptions
   - Receive change notifications from database-server-replica nodes
   - Forward real-time updates to connected subscribers
   - Optimized for: Connection handling, minimal latency, horizontal scaling
   - Can scale independently based on active subscriber count

**Node Management via System Table**:

The cluster should provide a `system.cluster_nodes` table for administrators to view and manage all nodes:

```sql
-- View all cluster nodes
SELECT * FROM system.cluster_nodes;

-- Columns: node_id, node_type, address, status, created_at, last_heartbeat, 
--          active_connections (for live-query nodes), 
--          buffered_rows (for database-server-replica nodes),
--          cpu_usage, memory_usage
```

**Architecture Benefits**:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Write-heavy workloads separate from connection-heavy workloads
- **Independent Scaling**: Scale live-query nodes for more subscribers, database-server-replica for more writes
- **Resource Optimization**: Live-query nodes don't need disk I/O, reducing infrastructure costs
- **Fault Tolerance**: Multiple database-server-replica nodes provide redundancy
- **Geographic Distribution**: Place live-query nodes close to users for low latency

**Implementation Considerations** (for future work):
- Node discovery and registration mechanism
- Health check and heartbeat protocols
- Load balancing for WebSocket connections across live-query nodes
- Change notification routing from database-server-replica to live-query nodes
- Node failure detection and automatic failover
- Metrics collection and monitoring per node type

**Why defer this?**: Distributed cluster architecture adds significant operational complexity. The current single-node architecture should be proven stable first, with clear performance bottlenecks identified before introducing node specialization.

```

### System Live Queries Monitoring
```sql

```

### User Table Operations
```sql
-- Create user table with auto-increment and location template
-- System automatically adds: _updated TIMESTAMP, _deleted BOOLEAN
CREATE USER TABLE messages (
    message_id BIGINT,
    conversation_id STRING,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    content STRING
)
LOCATION 's3://flowdb-data/users/${user_id}/messages/';

-- Create user table using predefined storage location
CREATE USER TABLE messages (
    message_id BIGINT,
    conversation_id STRING,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    content STRING
)
LOCATION REFERENCE 's3-prod';

-- Insert data (system sets _updated = NOW(), _deleted = false)
INSERT INTO messages (conversation_id, content)
VALUES ('conv123', 'Hello world');

-- Update data (system updates _updated = NOW())
UPDATE messages 
SET content = 'Updated message'
WHERE message_id = 12345;

-- Soft delete (system sets _deleted = true, _updated = NOW())
DELETE FROM messages WHERE message_id = 12345;

-- Query active messages (soft-deleted rows excluded by default)
SELECT * FROM messages WHERE conversation_id = 'conv123';
-- Equivalent to: SELECT * FROM messages WHERE conversation_id = 'conv123' AND _deleted = false

-- Query including soft-deleted rows (explicit filter)
SELECT * FROM messages WHERE conversation_id = 'conv123' AND _deleted = true;

-- Query changes since timestamp (uses _updated bloom filter)
SELECT * FROM messages WHERE _updated > '2025-10-14T00:00:00Z';
```
```
    content STRING
)
LOCATION 's3://flowdb-data/users/${user_id}/messages/';

-- Create user table with flush policy (row-based)
CREATE USER TABLE events (
    event_id BIGINT,
    event_type STRING,
    payload STRING
)
FLUSH POLICY ROWS 10000;

-- Create user table with soft delete retention
CREATE USER TABLE messages (
    message_id BIGINT,
    conversation_id STRING,
    content STRING
)
WITH (deleted_retention = '7d');  -- Keep deleted rows for 7 days

-- Create user table with no deleted row cleanup
CREATE USER TABLE audit_logs (
    log_id BIGINT,
    action STRING,
    details STRING
)
WITH (deleted_retention = 'off');  -- Never cleanup deleted rows

-- Create user table with flush policy (time-based)
CREATE USER TABLE logs (
    log_id BIGINT,
    message STRING,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
)
FLUSH POLICY INTERVAL '5 minutes';

-- Create user table with both flush policies
CREATE USER TABLE metrics (
    metric_id BIGINT,
    metric_name STRING,
    value DOUBLE,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP
)
FLUSH POLICY ROWS 5000 INTERVAL '1 minute';
```

### Stream Table Operations
```sql
-- Create stream table for ephemeral events (AI chat signals)
CREATE STREAM TABLE ai_signals (
    user_id STRING,
    conversation_id STRING,
    event_type STRING,  -- 'ai_typing', 'ai_thinking', 'user_offline', etc.
    payload JSON,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
)
WITH (
    retention = '10s',
    ephemeral = true,
    max_buffer = 1000
);

-- Insert ephemeral events
INSERT INTO ai_signals (user_id, conversation_id, event_type, payload, created_at)
VALUES ('user123', 'conv456', 'ai_typing', '{"text": ""}', NOW());

-- Subscribe to stream table events (real-time only)
SUBSCRIBE SELECT * FROM ai_signals 
WHERE conversation_id = 'conv456';

-- Drop stream table
DROP STREAM TABLE ai_signals;
```

### ALTER TABLE Operations (Schema Evolution)
```sql
-- Add a new column to existing user table
ALTER TABLE messages 
ADD COLUMN priority STRING DEFAULT 'normal';

-- Add multiple columns
ALTER TABLE messages
ADD COLUMN tags ARRAY<STRING>,
ADD COLUMN metadata JSON;

-- Drop a column (must not be referenced in active subscriptions)
ALTER TABLE messages
DROP COLUMN priority;

-- Modify column type (with validation)
ALTER TABLE messages
MODIFY COLUMN content TEXT;  -- Expand VARCHAR to TEXT

-- View schema history
DESCRIBE TABLE messages;
-- Output shows:
-- - current_version: 3
-- - schema_path: /configs/production/schemas/messages/current.json
-- - schema_history:
--   - v1 (2025-01-15): Initial schema
--   - v2 (2025-03-20): Added priority column
--   - v3 (2025-10-15): Removed priority, added tags and metadata

-- Querying after schema evolution
-- Old Parquet files (v1) will have NULL for new columns (tags, metadata)
SELECT * FROM messages WHERE tags IS NOT NULL;

-- Notes:
-- - ALTER TABLE NOT supported on stream tables (immutable)
-- - Cannot alter system columns (_updated, _deleted)
-- - Schema changes must be backwards-compatible with existing Parquet files
-- - Dropping columns fails if referenced in active live query subscriptions
```

### Live Query Subscriptions with Change Tracking
```sql
-- WebSocket subscription with single query

### Backup and Restore
```sql
-- Backup namespace (syntax inspired by DuckDB)
BACKUP DATABASE production TO 's3://backups/production_2025-10-14.backup';

-- Restore namespace
RESTORE DATABASE production FROM 's3://backups/production_2025-10-14.backup';

-- List backup contents
SHOW BACKUP 's3://backups/production_2025-10-14.backup';

-- Future: incremental backup
BACKUP DATABASE production TO 's3://backups/production_incremental.backup' 
MODE INCREMENTAL;
```

### Catalog Queries
```sql
-- List tables in current namespace
SHOW TABLES;
-- Output:
