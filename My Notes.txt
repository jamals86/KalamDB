Features:
- Add CLI tool which is using the API and you can login with specific user to do the actions inside of it, this should be a separate binary
    - This CLI Tool should use the kalamdb-client-sdk which is written in rust and will be compiled as webassembly
    - The client-sdk should also support query caching in the future (So instead than sending sql queries we can send object to prevent always parsing it)
    - For now we can only support typescript-sdk only
- Make the project has a generic serdes models, so we can change the serialization from the json
- A new table called user_files which is a table per user for storing files and their references in the storage location we have
- KFlows - Add a workflow triggers which also listen to streams, actions being done and write to the database
- KFlows will be used for system maintainance like: replication/backup and also periodict cleanup of deleted rows
- Sharding the user's own table's into multiple column families, for example: userA will be redirected to Shard A -> with users.shard-a.messages
    If we have like 5 user tables and 10 shards in total we will have 50 column families
- Raft Cluster - System tables should be replicated to all nodes
- Raft Cluster - User tables each shard should have a group in the cluster and replicated accordingly
- User can easily download his data
- Parallel writers with sharding per user
- compaction jobs that runs per user whenever he has many parquet files in the system
- Add an optimizre which runs in the background and check if the queries/design is all correctly functioning like:
    - If a table is a shared table and has many rows
    - If a user table is getting big
    - more will come later, the archeticture should support this


Tools & Utilities:
- Build as a docker container Dokerfile
- An example of running with docker-compose
- Auto-deploy to github as an executables
- 




Notes:
1) devide the cli test into multiple files
